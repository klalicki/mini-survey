# mini-survey

A web app for quickly building, distributing, and collecting surveys.

## Background

I am building this app to make it easier to 'pulse-check' my students (I teach as an adjunct at a college!). This app will make it easier to quickly gauge students' status, such as progress on projects, or their understanding of new material.

## Technology

This project is built in React with Typescript. It uses Next.js as a build tool/backend framework. It has a backend, built with Next.js Serverless Functions, that queries and manipulates a cloud-deployed MongoDB database.
